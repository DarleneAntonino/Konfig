1. This project lists drinks form a menu. Given we had a *SimpleDrink.java*, *Drink.java* and *Liquid.java*. \
2. The class *SimpleDrink.java* didn't hold a main, so we have to include one. \
3. Next, we implement a class for *MixedDrinks.java* and *HotBeverag.java*.\
4. For testing, if everything is working, we make the *main.java* that includes the list with the drinks.\
5. The method *TestMyException.smallEnough()* throws if the drink is too big for a glass.\
