1.. This project lists drinks form a menu. Given we had a *SimpleDrink.java*, *Drink.java* and *Liquid.java*. 
2. The class *SimpleDrink.java* didn't hold a main, so we included one. 
3. Next, we implemented a class for *MixedDrinks.java* and *HotBeverag.java*.
4. Do test if everything is working, we made the *main.java* that includes the list with the drinks. 
5. The method *MyEcxetpion.java* gives back a boolean to look if a drink has to muck alcohol or not.
